				 		I was born and grew up in Nepal. I went to Art instituate of Washington for my bachelor's degree in Media arts and Animationand and recently graduated as a 3D character rigger and animator.
				
						<br>I am currently working as a freelance arrtist. To me, to be a successful character rigger, computer programming serves one of the major asset to boost my work flow which I felt lacking in skills. So I decided to learn coding which means a most powerful tool to my professional career in Media Arts and Animation as well as web developement industry.
